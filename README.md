# book.log Library Management System

November 08, 2017

book.log is a functional Library Management System which allows patrons to browse through books by popularity and recency, as well as to query the Library Database for titles, authors, or ISBNs. Patrons can also save books as their favorites, or reserve books to check out later. Employees are able to add and remove books, as well as check out books for patrons (or for themselves). Patron and employee authorization is implemented through Google Firebase.
